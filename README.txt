Interesting topics in relation to computers:
	
	1	BioEngineering Applications	(i.e. regrowing nerve cell connections)

	2	The Dark Web				(from a purely scientific perspective)
	
	3	Quantum Computing			(the following article details two-qubit gates, how addressing the gates' problems is like
									"peeling an onion" in which the quantum-team keeps encountering more problems with each
									solution.  However what they did discover is that redundant gates reduce their problem
									of extra noise.  This would be acceptable for regular computing, but not for quantum.)

	4	Cryptology					(specifically it's relation to mathematics)
	
	5	A.I.						(I'm fascinated with this topic, it's unknowns, and where it could take us as a society.)


Challenging topics in relation to computers:

	1	A.I.						(I'm trepidatious about this topic and how A.I. could be irreversable or even spiral out of control.)
	
	2	Security Issues				(Is it worth it to give up some freedoms for security in regards to recording or tracking?)
	
	3	Hardware Accessibility 		(specifically processor chips being in short supply and high demand.  Despite being able to make
									leaps and bounds in computing, innovators are limited by the resources of our current climate.)
	
	4	Social Consequences			(The last 1.5 years will be a great case-study for how human interaction or at least meetings
									have shifted from face-to-face preference with hand-shakes to general resourcefullness becoming
									the focus and therefore not requiring everyone going online with eachother to be in a physical room -
									a virtual conference room, one would argue, could be superior to a physical one.  The list of Pro's and
									Con's for each argument could be quite extensive.)
									
	5	Coding Cobwebs				(I have coded in Python and ran functions in MATLAB, SCILAB, and R.  However this was over the course of
									a good few years with gaps in my practice and therefore there are some coding cobwebs to dust off.)
